# UPnPMapper
Discover universal plug and play devices on your local network

This project was inspired by the [PortMiner project](https://github.com/smithy212000/PortMiner). I first wanted to see if I had any UPnP devices that I could leverage in order to host a Minecraft server with `zeroconf` port forwarding.
